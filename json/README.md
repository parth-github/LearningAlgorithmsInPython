JSON 
#########
The first is a Name-Value pair which in
a programming language could be realised as an object, record, struct,dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.

"first_name" : "Jacob"
The name here can be any String.

The value can be one of the following:
• A number
• A String
• A Boolean
• A JSON Array
• An object
• null

#############
The second type is the JSON Object. A JSON Object is a collection of name-value pairs or Arrays encased in curly brackets.

{ "first_name":"Jacob" , "last_name":"Bellamy" }

###############

Lastly, we have the JSON Array. A JSON Array roughly corresponds to a list in python. A JSON array is a list of values encased in square brackets. For example:
{"courses": ["Compsci 101", "Compsci 105", "Compsci 107"]}
